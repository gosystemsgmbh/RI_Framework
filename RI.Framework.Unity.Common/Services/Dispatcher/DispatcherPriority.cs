	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="Now" />: The operation is executed in the same thread it is dispatched from.
	///         The created <see cref="IDispatcherOperation" /> will already have its <see cref="IDispatcherOperation.Status" /> set to <see cref="DispatcherStatus.Processed" />.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="Frame" />: The operation is executed in the main/foreground thread.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="Later" />: The operation is executed in the main/foreground thread.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="Idle" />: The operation is executed in the main/foreground thread.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="Background" />: The operation is executed in a background thread assigned by <see cref="ThreadPool" />.
	///         The behaviour of <see cref="ThreadPool" /> depends on how it is configured and the used platform.
	///         A dispatcher operation with <see cref="Background" /> priority cannot be canceled, rescheduled, or its timeout set after the end of the frame the operation was dispatched in.
	///         The <see cref="IDispatcherOperation.Result" /> property is set from the background thread.
	///         The <see cref="IDispatcherOperation.Status" /> property is set from the main/foreground thread.
	///         Any finish callback (<see cref="IDispatcherOperation.OnFinished" />) is called from the main/foreground thread.
	///         Therefore, only use <see cref="IDispatcherOperation.Status" /> or the finish callback to process or detect the end of an operations processing!
	///     </para>
	///     <note type="important">
	///         Use <see cref="Later" /> and <see cref="Idle" /> with caution! An operation with one of those priorities is non-deterministic and might never be executed in cases where operations of higher priorities are constantly dispatched (e.g. the dispatcher never becomes idle)!
