	/// <remarks>
	///     <para>
	///         Database version upgraders are used to upgrade a databases version from version n to version n+1.
	///         What the upgrade does in detail depends on the database type and the implementation of <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader" />.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         Database version upgraders are used by database managers (<see cref="IDatabaseManager" /> implementations).
	///         Do not use database version upgraders directly but rather configure to use them through configuration (<see cref="IDatabaseManagerConfiguration" />.<see cref="IDatabaseManagerConfiguration.VersionUpgrader" />).
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         Implementations of <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader" /> are always specific for a particular type of database (or particular implementation of <see cref="IDatabaseManager" /> respectively).
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         Database version upgraders are optional.
	///         If not configured, upgrading is not available / not supported.
	///     </para>
	///     <para>
	///         <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader" /> performs upgrades incrementally through multiple calls to <see cref="Upgrade" />.
	///         <see cref="Upgrade" /> is always called for the current/source version and then upgrades to the current/source version + 1.
	///         Therefore, <see cref="IDatabaseManager" /> implementations call <see cref="Upgrade" /> as many times as necessary to upgrade incrementally from a current version to the desired version.
