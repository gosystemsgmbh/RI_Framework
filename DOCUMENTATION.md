# Documentation

Please read the [overview](README.md) to get started and to get additional information.

## Using the framework

Each [release](README.md) contains an API documentation about its assemblies, namespaces, types, and members.

## History, Motivation & Reinventing the wheel

The Decoupling & Utilities Framework was originally a collection of functions which were used in multiple private projects, simply as a container for code reuse.

As it grew over time, accumulating more and more functionality, the framework was made into its own standalone project and eventually polished and open-sourced.

The motivation to write a particular function and put it into the framework was (and still is) one or more of the following:

 * It did not exist.
 * It did exist, but the implementation was following too different requirements or guidelines.
 * It did exist, but the implementation was unsatisfying (style, abstractions, customizability, quality, license, etc.).
 * Productivity concerns ("Learning/customizing takes at least as long as writing it myself").
 * Naivety, [not-invented-here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrom, overconfidence ("I can do this better").
 * Educational purposes ("I need to experience the problems of implementing this myself").
 * Fun (ever tried to write a composition container yourself? What an adventure!).

Therefore, keep in mind that this framework is not a silver bullet and you should take the time to check whether it (or parts of it) is really what you need.

## Roadmap

The short-term roadmap includes:

 * API cleanup & completeness
 * Documentation cleanup & completeness
 * Bugfixes

The medium-term roadmap includes:

 * More unit tests and better test coverage
 * Improvement of existing functions
 * Small and medium enhancements
 * More documentation, examples, and tutorials

The long-term roadmap includes several large enhancements:

 * Functionality for additional application types:
   * Web applications
   * Mobile applications \*
   * Mobile games \*
 * Support for additional runtimes/targets:
   * .NET Standard
   * .NET Core
   * Xamarin \*
 * Extensions for additional libraries/frameworks:
   * ASP.NET Core
   * Entity Framework Core

## Tools

### Required tools

The following tools are required in order to successfully build the project:

 * [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 2017 15.7.1 or newer
 * [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) 2018.1.1 or newer
 * [Visual Studio Tools for Unity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/visual-studio-tools-for-unity) 3.7.0.1 or newer
 * [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) 2017.5.15.0 or newer

### Recommended tools

The following tools are recommended but not necessary to build the project:

 * [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)

## Code organization

### Visual Studio

The history of the framework is still somewhat visible in its structure, mostly in a very Visual Studio centric organization and workflow.

There are no "loose files" as every file is a part of the Visual Studio solution or one of its C# projects.

A few C# projects are also "misused" for file grouping/organization without actually producing an usable assembly.

### Build procedure

The build procedure relies entirely on Visual Studio as custom steps are implemented in batch scripts which are tied to Visual Studio project prebuild and postbuild events.

The build output is generated in the *_Output* folder in the directory of the Visual Studio solution.
The redistributable package is generated in the *_Packages* folder in the directory of the Visual Studio solution.

Note that to save time while doing "normal" work on the code, not all Visual Studio projects are built by default when the soultion is (re)built.

### Assemblies vs. Namespaces

The separation of code into assemblies is based on dependencies and not functionality.

This means that everything which has the same dependencies is put into the same assembly, while everything which belongs to the same functionality is put into the same namespace.
If a certain functionality is not used, simply do not use the corresponding namespace.

## Compatibility

Not all functions are available for all runtimes/targets or on all platforms. See documentation for details.
