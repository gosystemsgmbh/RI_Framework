	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// Database version upgraders are used to upgrade a databases version from version n to version n+1.
	/// What the upgrade does in detail depends on the database type and the implementation of <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader"/>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Database version upgraders are used by database managers (<see cref="IDatabaseManager"/> implementations).
	/// Do not use database version upgraders directly but rather configure to use them through configuration (<see cref="IDatabaseManagerConfiguration"/>.<see cref="IDatabaseManagerConfiguration.VersionUpgrader"/>).
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Implementations of <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader"/> are always specific for a particular type of database (or particular implementation of <see cref="IDatabaseManager"/> respectively).
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Database version upgraders are optional.
	/// If not configured, upgrading is not available / not supported.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <see cref="IDatabaseVersionUpgrader"/> performs upgrades incrementally through multiple calls to <see cref="Upgrade"/>.
	/// <see cref="Upgrade"/> is always called for the current/source version and then upgrades to the current/source version + 1.
	/// Therefore, <see cref="IDatabaseManager"/> implementations call <see cref="Upgrade"/> as many times as necessary to upgrade incrementally from a current version to the desired version.
